# Sea-Battle
A small silly browser game which was popular on arcade machines 20 years ago in my hometown.
It wasn't supposed to be deployed on a life server, it was my the very first javaScript app and the purpose was to get accustomed to using
event listeners, ES6 classes and modules as well as understanding events and promises. So, no design and style.

Still, can be deployed and does not require a server. If you're a fun of old games, this might wind up an enjoyable one.
